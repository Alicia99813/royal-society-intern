# simple-site

This is a very simple set processes for creating a standard set of webpages based on a simple json file.

An example set of pages can be seen at: [simple-site](https://jpadfield.github.io/simple-site/)

The content of the pages are controlled with three [json](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files stored in the build folder, further details are supplied with in the build directory [ReadMe](./build/README.md) file:

* Various site wide details are defined within the [site.json](./build/site.json) file.
* The content for the various main pages, which will be listed as tabs, are defined within the [pages.json](./build/pages.json) file.
* Any required sub-pages can then also be defined within the [sub-pages.json](./build/sub-pages.json) file. These sub-pages, or even sub-sub-pages etc, will not be given main tabs, but will be listed as buttons beneath the appropriate main page.

Once the json files are updated a new set of html pages can be generated by running the command **php build.php** within the build directory of a local/downloaded copy of this repository.

# Dependencies

Once built, simple html pages should run without any additional software, all of the basic required [js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [css](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) files are already included, but newer versions can be added in if required:
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)

To actually build new sets of html pages from the edited json files you will also need to have **php** installed:
* [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)

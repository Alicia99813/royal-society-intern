	"content": "<h3>What is JSON?<\/h3>\r\n<p>JSON stands for <b>J<\/b>ava<b>S<\/b>cript <b>O<\/b>bject <b>N<\/b>otation and is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. It should be relatively \"self-describing\" and easy to understand[@@https:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/whatis\/whatis_json.asp].<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>JSON files are organised in comma separated name\/value pairs held within curly brackets, with additional non-named lists held within square brackets. It is also important to ensure that none of the names or values include any newline characters or special JSON characters. There are a large number of websites describing all of the details and rules of the JSON format, but unless you would really like to learn there is a simple solution. If in doubt just copy and paste you name or value text into an online JSON formatting tool and let it do the work[@@https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Escape_character] for you, then copy the processed text into your file and move on.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many of these tools online, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>[www.freeformatter.com|https:\/\/www.freeformatter.com\/json-escape.html]<\/li>\r\n<li>[codebeautify.org|https:\/\/codebeautify.org\/json-escape-unescape]<\/li>\r\n<li>Or simply explore [Google|https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=escape+json].<\/li>\r\n<\/ul><\/p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n\t\t<pre style=\"overflow: hidden;border: 2px solid black;padding: 10px;\">\r\n<code>{\r\n  \"<b>DataSetName<\/b>\": {\r\n    \"<b>Name<\/b>\": \"Value\",\r\n    \"<b>Another Name<\/b>\": \"Another Value\",\r\n    \"<b>List Name(for example shapes)<\/b>\": [\r\n      {\"shape\": \"square\", \"colour\": \"blue\"},\r\n      {\"shape\": \"circle\", \"colour\": \"red\"},\r\n      {\"shape\": \"triangle\", \"colour\": \"yellow\"}\r\n      ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n<\/code><\/pre><figcaption class=\\\"figure-caption\\\">Simplified example of a JSON data object.<\/figcaption>\r\n<\/figure>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to ensuring that individual name of value texts are correctly processed it is also common, when editing an existing JSON file to make small errors, forgetting a comma, or a double quotes, etc. If your files start to get longer it is often useful just to check that your file is still a valid JSON file before submitting it. As with the escape process above there are a number of free online tools to do this, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>[jsonlint.com|https:\/\/jsonlint.com\/]<\/li>\r\n\t<li>[www.freeformatter.com|https:\/\/www.freeformatter.com\/json-validator.html]<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Or simply explore [Google|https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=validate+json].<\/li>\r\n<\/ul><\/p>\r\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\" role=\"alert\"><h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Take Care<\/h4><p>Ensure your text values have been correctly [escaped|https:\/\/www.freeformatter.com\/json-escape.html] &#8608; and check your JSON files are [valid|https:\/\/jsonlint.com\/] before submitting them!<\/p><\/div>",
